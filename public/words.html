<p>1000° whistled on the floor-</p>
<p>Was it I who healed the frowning sage doll
         &amp; comforted the pale open road,
while you dropped the flashing guard rail 
         &amp; decapitated the smiling gingerbread man?</p>
<p>Did you taste the acrid powder
         &amp; watch the children follow a military beat?</p>
<p>Did you hear my father play a peaceful flute
        &amp; reject the icy darkness?</p>
<p>Did you stand on top of the oily earth
                 &amp; savor the cockroaches grin like wine,
while I sat beneath the chessboard tile sky
                    &amp; heard the firefly squeal?</p>
<p>I knew when I smelt the blue plastic
that it was you who melted
the empty saxophone with rainwater!</p>
<p>You who chose the path of the day &amp; 
                                    it was-</p>
<p>The rabid chainsaw devouring the redwoods’ sinuous trunks
             as the butterflies’ nectar slid on his golden watch.</p>
<p>The plutonium power planted on a fault line
             as the craven raven looked at an electric wire.</p>
<p>The mindful television channel streaming sterility
              into the toddlers embryonic imagination.</p>
<p>The turtle painted red on the pavement 
              by the petroleum horse.</p>
<p>The caterpillars crap pasted to your seat
              littered from the green breathing skeletons. </p>
<p>But when you honored “With Satan I Deceive&quot;
                             &amp; smiled to Benedict Arnold
                             under the guise of ”In God We Trust”
                             I bowed to Benjamin Franklin.</p>
<p>No longer could I ignore the raptured eyes
                              of the fragile saplings.</p>

It did not faze the stoned crowd laid back in the U-shaped couch. They did not move. They just blew smoke triangles and stared at the parabolic circles stitched into the fabric that their bodies were resting on.</p>\n<p>Half bottles of booze, abandoned beer cans, dead cigarettes, and shattered tortilla chips were spread about the kitchen countertop. Twenty or so guests moved about the kitchen until the bubble gum cloud quickly evaporated and morphed into hundreds of twisted chrome metal insects the same size as wasps.</p>\n<p>The thin Latin girl with sensuous lips by my side was the first to notice.  She grabbed my arm and pointed at the insectile army whose thousand heads were upon her. &quot;Check that shit out!&quot;</p>\n<p>A longhaired, bearded man with a corduroy top hat yelled in delight from his slouched position on the floor and pointed a finger. He removed his chopsticks from the eye socket of the antelope&#39;s skull before biting into it like a plump grape.  Grabbing the other eyeball, he turned it to face the swarm of insects and said, &quot;I see, but he doesn&#39;t&quot;.</p>\n<p>The Latin girl screamed. No one else noticed, but the bearded man and I. &quot;Leave her alone&quot; I shouted at them as they began to enter the Latin girl&#39;s flesh like cactus needles. Instinctually, I went to the refrigerator, latched onto a bowl of rainbow Jell-O and threw it at her.</p>\n<p>The metal insects struggled with the Jell-O, succumbing to its gelatinous power. My reaction was promptly repaid with a slap from her thin hand, which bolted down my right cheek and entered the floor splintering the entire loft in two.  A crack began to spew a bubblegum liquid as the building melted into a sea of pink substance that couldn&#39;t be categorized as liquid gas or solid.</p>\n<p>I&#39;m out of here, the bearded man said, as he pranced through the bay window with the grace of the circus tiger into the cosmic blue night.  Soon the night was dotted with the metal insects and everyone was now awake or semiconscious and leaving in haste. They somersaulted off the balcony, tripped down the spiral staircase, and others dropped into the crack like brass pens.</p>\n<p>Following the bearded man&#39;s lead I traveled through the bay window, choking on the mist and struggling with the substance as I landed with a rubber thud on a floating wedge of cheese the size of a sedan. The Latin girl and the bearded man were already present, each sitting in the lotus position, and appearing to be meditating deeply.  I touched the Latin girl&#39;s shoulder softly, it had turned to stone.  Frantically, I shook the bearded man. No response. The water from the bubblegum sea clashed with the cheese wedge and sprayed a glop of steaming heap of tapioca on my face.</p>\n<p>The alarm clock seared the numbers 12:00 upon my tender retina. What is this moisture? Out of one eye the misty image of my boxer appeared above as a large planet discharging lagoons of saliva onto my face.</p>\n"},{"title":"The Time Mill","_categories":["content","words","stories"],"_url":"/content/words/stories/the-time-mill.html","content":"<h3 id=\"the-time-mill\">The Time Mill</h3>\n<p>The sun melted like an iceberg behind me as I handed the lady a five-dollar bill and told her to keep the change and waited for the canoe to arrive. She dropped some solid bubbles into the tea and they sank to the bottom of the cup like stones. I sucked on the straw as the brown balls entered my mouth. I chewed them like tapioca. With each sip I saw the wrinkles in my hands disappear and my forearms were bulging, sinews as tight as a cedar&#39;s trunk. When the boat arrived, I passed the tea to the blue heron at the bow, plucked a feather and began to stroke the dark river. The canoe glided along in silence, past lotus flowers, frog-laden lily pads and through a rolling thick mist and then I saw my destination; the mill. Golden fish swam around us in warped orbits when we arrived. The blue heron stayed inside the canoe and waited with a hungry smile. A carved inverted cone stood as tall as a fully-grown maple tree and the gilded paint flashed in the moon&#39;s glow. We approached it slowly, and once the shape of my feather&#39;s shadow was no longer bent, I knew that I could enter the hatch.</p>\n<p>Inside the cone was a long coiled ramp. I crawled in on all fours and looked at the walls painted in turquoise and red, which depicted my mythic struggles with a cobra. The cobra&#39;s tale began at the base of the coil and Sanskrit tiles wrapped around the walls and ended at the cone&#39;s tip. When I reach the pinnacle of the cone, I grabbed the carved femur of a giraffe and struck the crystal bell. I did not hear its initial sound, only the echo that bounced back from against the horizon. The deep chime signaled the Buddha&#39;s spell. I promptly boarded the canoe and saw the heron with a golden fish in a beak. Not much was left to do, so I paddled carefully to the stilted hut on the river and sipped my tea.</p>\n<p>A rope ladder hung from the hut, and I climbed it to reach the inside where thirty-three stoic Buddhas sat in a circle. I sat in the middle of them; my wristwatch&#39;s face winked at me and I winked back. It was time. I bowed in reverence. Without further notice, each of their bellies one after another was quivering. In unison they erupted into a simultaneous belly laugh. I sipped my tea, shot the solid balls from my straw into their open mouths and observed them now levitating.  Sighing with contentment, I laughed back. Then I hopped aboard the canoe, nodded to the heron and paddled into the vast morning star.</p>\n<p> My work was complete as the silhouette of the  time mill hung in the night.  As I paddled back towards the dock the crevices in my hand became more prominent.  It wouldn&#39;t be long, I thought to myself before I could order another cup of tea.</p>\n"},{"title":"The Truckdriver","_categories":["content","words","stories"],"_url":"/content/words/stories/the-truckdriver.html","content":"<h3 id=\"the-truckdriver\">The Truckdriver</h3>\n<p>The deciduous trees on either side of the road leaned together and blended forming a tunnel. Danh pulled over his F350 extended cab over to the right lane and parked on the side of an embankment.  He had tried to turn the triangle mirror into a different angle to maximize airflow to his head. No relief. His armpits were still moist, and the beads of sweat fell off his nose and onto his pants. He clicked the door handle, jumped down from the truck, and walked across the street to the bridge that lay like a rainbow over river. </p>\n<p>Gazing at a tree&#39;s reflections on the slow moving river for a second, he caught himself and remembered that he only had a short while. The bridge groaned as he walked over, the planks were dry and thin. He began to walk faster. </p>\n<p>Walking in a zigzag pattern, he kept looking over his back.  After he followed a deer trail beside the river for 100 paces he found the crescent shaped rock that he was looking for.  Squinting his eyes to look into the woods he unbuttoned his shirt and saw the small patch of dirt. A thin patch of baby grass and the myriad of fallen limbs he placed across it made the area appear undisturbed.</p>\n<p>His fingers pulsed with a new rush of blood when he saw a stranger walking with a limp down the path. To protect himself, he glared at the stranger. He knew he looked foreign. As the man walked by he said &quot;not a bad day for a little hike, but a little humid though&quot;.</p>\n<p>Danh did not answer. He did not understand what the man said. He only understood the word &quot;hello.&quot; </p>\n<p>He nodded his head. Once the man had disappeared behind the corner, he knew it was okay to proceed back.  As he tiptoed back towards his truck, the shade of the pine trees cooled his body, but his mind began to heat up. What had he done?  He thought about Daisy, he thought about his hound, and he wondered if this year&#39;s crop would be worth all of his anxiety and effort. </p>\n"}],"articles":[{"title":"Shift to the Green Marketplace","link":"http://www.ecomall.com/greenshopping/chad.htm","date":2000,"_categories":["content","words","articles"],"_url":"/content/words/articles/the-shift-to-green-marketplace.html","content":"<h3 id=\"shift-to-the-green-marketplace\">Shift to the Green Marketplace</h3>\n<p>&quot;Whoever controls the media, controls the mind&quot; were the written words of the late poet and musician Jim Morrison. A simplistically haunting idea, to think that we may not control our own desires. Every year, every day, every hour we stroll upon advertisements, flowing from magazines, beaming from outdoor signs and flickering from televisions. Thinking that many of these illusionary tools just flutter past our interpretation. But, who really controls this power of propaganda? How much are we a product of the media&#39;s influence? How much do advertisements affect our behavior and perceptions?</p>\n<p>Advertisers directly influence the media in two ways. First, the advertisers have the ability to suppress the type and the amount of information that we receive. Any propangada that could hinder the image of the sponsor will be completely silenced. Secondly, the media device will cultivate an arena that will allow the sponsor to shine a positive illumination. The television programs that we are exposed to are scientifically placed to capture different degrees of our attention. Sometimes corporate public relations sectors will even air a segment on news stations as a legitimate discovery.</p>\n<p>So how much power do corporations hold in affecting the information that we absorb everyday? Statistically up to 85% of the news that American&#39;s view is bought and paid for by corporations. How many advertisements are we subjected to every day? &quot;The average American is exposed to at least 3000 ads every day and will spend three years of his or her life watching television commercials. An average of sixteen to seventeen minutes of primetime network television per hour is set aside strictly for advertisements.&quot; (Grey). Advertisers even probe into our media outlets from magazines to newspapers to mail. Ads make up about 70% or our newspapers and 40% of our mail (Kilbourne).</p>\n<p>A large amount of advertiser power lies within the area of disbelief of affection. Propaganda, which is not recognized as propaganda, is the most effective kind. Allowing many of us to laugh, giggle and think that these ads are ridiculous and frivolous. Yet at the same time breaking down our guard, and this is when the advertisement does its job.</p>\n<p>Not only are we bombarded by direct advertisements, we are also hit constantly by icons attached to specific products and services. Athletes, politicians, and entertainers are essentially &quot;live products&quot;. As a society we mimic, model and create role models of many celebrities. Some of these role models are so entwined into product endorsement that we unconsciously connect the two; Michael Jordan with Nike, or Glen Plake with K2 Skis. I will use this great analogy to emphasize the power of advertisements:</p>\n<p>The father sat reflecting on how much joy his two sons brought to him during the year. He decided to buy them both the present of their choice this holiday season. When he asked his older boy what he would like, the son replied, &#39;Oh boy, I would like so many things. Maybe a bike, or new skis, or skin diving equipment. I wish I would have them all, but any one would make me happy&#39;.</p>\n<p>That was fine with the father, he now had some good choices. Next he turned to his younger son, who was only eight years old. The boy envied his brother for all the games he could play and all of the sports that he could do so well. When asked what he would like, he made one simple request. &#39;I would like a box of Tampax Tampons.&#39; The father was shocked, &#39;What in the world do you want a box of tampons for?&quot; he demanded angrily. The poor boy, not knowing he has said something wrong, answered, &#39; With Tampax, you can swim, ski, sky dive, horseback ride and play any sport you want.&quot;</p>\n<p>This simple yet enlightening story allows us to look at the seriousness of advertisements. Advertisers can influence our desires for material products and ethical ideals. Looking to the future, this science tries to construct images within us at a young age. The silly Budweiser Frogs allow many young children to have a positive connection with alcohol. These kids will age and the large majority of individuals will sustain the connection. Young children especially are naïve, allowing these ads to be more effective.</p>\n<p>In 1999, advertisers spent a record $201.5 billion dollars to promote their products. Why are businesses paying this large sum of their capital to advertising agencies? According to industry analysts, advertising serves three basic functions. First, to recruit new customers secondly, to increase the use of goods or services among existing customers and thirdly, to help consumers prefer their product over the competition. This service can and does create new markets more promptly, more intensively, and less expensively than any other method of selling to the consumer.</p>\n<p>How can we make companies switch to a greener marketplace?</p>\n<p>Why haven&#39;t today&#39;s current corporations invested in a greener marketplace? Many producers today are struggling with the existing perverse incentives towards a green production. These companies have made substantial investments in capital equipment for their already established product line. Also, for many companies to enter the green marketplace they will call unwanted publicity their way. In essence, inviting a critical appraisal of their environmental performance. Not only would an existing company bring in this unwanted publicity, but they would also be turning the table, placing a greater emphasis upon environmental performance. &quot; They would run the risk of letting fresh air into a market structure that is pretty well sealed right now-and tilted very much in their favor. By going &#39;deep green,&#39; in other words, they would open the door to a new buying culture, with potentially grievous consequences for their established franchise&quot; (Frankel)</p>\n<p>These large stacks of moneybags exist in front of our path leading to a more sustainable consumerism. What ways can we slowly break through this wall? What alternatives will the market create? In order for us to push an era of green consumerism into the mainstream, we need to start to infiltrate the mainstream with a whole lot of education. The first step is educating the public about environmental matters. People can not change their consumer choices without knowing what their products do and where they came from. I feel very confidently that many people would do more if they only knew what impact their current choices are having on our environment. What is the fastest and most effective way to inform the mass media? Television! This is where the power of advertising can be utilized to provide a positive light and capture the attention of many minds.</p>\n<p>Will a Consumer pay a Premium for Green Products?</p>\n<p>One of the largest obstacles that companies producing green products need to overcome is the attached idea of a higher price. This common conception flows through consumers&#39; minds and many do not want to pay a premium for an environmental product. A successful green product will hold benefits other than that of appeals to altruism. Most consumers know very little about the environment, which leads them to become skeptics. Leading them to judge upon industries claims and retailers price hikes. Also, it is a very important concept to note that consumers try to minimize their purchasing risks by buying brands they know. (Ottman)</p>\n<p>The media and trends play a big role in the introduction and purchase of green products. When a consumer can connect a green product with health benefits, the scale turns towards the side of the environment. One instance is the incredible growth of organic products. The perceived health benefits have led this industry to grow by twenty five percent annually.</p>\n<p>The main reason people shop is to get products, not to save the environment. This basic principal leads green marketing ventures to provide prices and performance that match with the competition. People will choose over some competitive brands for those that help the environment, as long as the prices are similar. Thus, the primary focus of many green producers should be upon the ultimate benefits that consumers would receive, topped with an environmental cherry. (Ottoman)</p>\n<p>So what are some successful companies who have boarded the environmental train doing? A great success story lies within the research and development of the Phillips Electronics company. They have found the right balance of production, coupling great benefits with green products. They began a green campaign called Eco-vision in 1998, which resulted in a few very profitable and energy saving products. The Kala, DECT telephones, and a 32-inch television are among some of the most flourishing. The key component behind Philips research is &quot;the stated willingness to buy green products when bundled with other benefits. Philips researchers found that linking such environmental attributes as energy reduction, material reduction, and toxic substance reduction with various material, immaterial, and emotional benefits desired by consumers, raises consumer purchases interest to 60 percent or above- a figure that includes consumers who may be negatively predisposed to the environment.&quot; (Ottman) It is clearly shown that the Philips company has created a system of marketing and advertising that applies to all consumers, not just the small percentage of green consumers focused on altruism.</p>\n<p>Another company which has used its environmental mission to achieve an edge over the competition is Tom&#39;s of Maine. Tom&#39;s of Maine is a natural self-care product business located in the quaint town of Kennebunk, Maine. Tom Chappel and his wife Kate founded their company on the interest of providing natural safe products that support the principal that all forms of nature should be respected and sustained.</p>\n<p>Tom&#39;s of Maine success has resulted from its dedication to its mission and friendly business practices. They have implemented critical strategies to make their company a prosperous enterprise. Tom&#39;s of Maine started by using only the finest natural ingredients in their products, which contain no additives, artificial flavors or fragrances. Their products are wrapped in recyclable materials, some of which have been previously recycled and others capable of being readily recycled. They too have found the successful mixture between a superior product and environmental consideration.</p>\n<p>They have also allowed the consumer to understand what their products are composed of and where the ingredients and their sources can be found. They have used advertising on their products that explain their mission, their ingredients and their dedication to preserving the environment.</p>\n<p>Another key concept the company has utilized is the emphasis on company-consumer relationships. The company&#39;s customer service department is exceptional, anyone who calls is greeted personally, and all letters are responded too promptly. They have also expanded their market to children, by adding a mixture of color, taste, and safety. Along with their many charitable donations Tom&#39;s of Maine has obtained customer trust, loyalty and personal connections. Their new wave of green business strategies has led them to increased sales. The company&#39;s sales have risen 25 percent from 1991 to 1995 and are growing. Tom&#39;s of Maine is a perfect example of how companies can preserve the environment, educate the masses, and sell products to reach the mainstream consumer. (Ottman)</p>\n<p>Problems with the Greening of Advertisements Unfortunately, as the green movement is slowly breaking into the mainstream culture there are companies who want a free ride. Today, supermarket shelves, hardware stores, mall-carts and other retail shops are filled with products and packages announcing environmental features that may influence our purchasing decisions.</p>\n<p>What do claims like &quot;environmentally safe&quot;, &quot;recyclable&quot;, &quot;degradable&quot;, or &quot;ozone friendly&quot; really mean? Recently, the Federal Trade Commission and the Environmental Protection Agency have developed several guidelines for advertisers to follow. Trying to guarantee that some environmental marketing lines do not mislead consumer&#39;s choices. Industry has developed a few smooth and soft environmental labels, which cease to be much help. Claims such as &quot;environmentally friendly&quot;, &quot;environmentally safe&quot;, &quot;environmentally preferable&quot;, &quot;Eco-safe&quot; or labels that contain environmental seals are very ambiguous and show no environmental validity to the product&quot;(EPA)</p>\n<p>There are a few reasons why these labels are misleading. First, all products and services result in an environmental impact, some causing more than others do. Secondly, many of these claims do not adequately provide the necessary information we need to compare products.</p>\n<p>As consumers, we must be wary and seek out the additional information that may explain why this particular product is &quot;environmentally friendly&quot;. There are myriad of different labels, seals, symbols and alphabet soups that companies adhere to their products. The best way to ensure that the products that we buy are truly environmentally friendly is to check out www.epa.gov. The FTC has outlined and detailed the many claims and identified them accordingly.</p>\n<h4 id=\"the-future-of-green-companies\">The Future of Green Companies</h4>\n<p>We have just begun down the road toward a sustainable market place. How far will we go? Where does the future lie? According to a recent Economist magazine, &quot;For far-sighted companies, the environment may turn out to be the biggest opportunity for enterprise and invention the industrial world has ever seen.&quot; The reason for this is because the health of the environment effects all colors, classes, ethnic groups and races. Every living human requires the essential elements of food, clothing, shelter, transportation and energy and these cruxes are all affected by the environment.</p>\n<p>With the great expansion of technology, the green industry is moving closer and closer into the mainstream. &quot;The World Wide Web is fast becoming an essential tool for green marketers. Many of the 17 million to 24 million regular web users earn a medium income of $50,000 to $60,000 are highly educated. These upscale demographics match those of environmental alert consumers&quot; (Ottman) The World Wide Web may be the place to kick off the beginning of a great change in consumerism. Consumers are more able to obtain information than ever before. If we as a culture start to shift our ideologies towards a green marketplace, this will be a great step in preserving the environment. Advertising could be the cornerstone to an ecological revolution, educating the masses at early ages, and leading consumers to develop a strong connection with the environment. These children will one-day be next the corporate CEO&#39;s, bank administrators and advertisers. With the information we have now we may be able to reconstruct our ecological ethics and maintain a healthy world of bio-diversity.</p>\n"}]};</script>
