<h3 id="the-truckdriver">The Truckdriver</h3>
<p>The deciduous trees on either side of the road leaned together and blended forming a tunnel. Danh pulled over his F350 extended cab over to the right lane and parked on the side of an embankment.  He had tried to turn the triangle mirror into a different angle to maximize airflow to his head. No relief. His armpits were still moist, and the beads of sweat fell off his nose and onto his pants. He clicked the door handle, jumped down from the truck, and walked across the street to the bridge that lay like a rainbow over river. </p>
<p>Gazing at a tree&#39;s reflections on the slow moving river for a second, he caught himself and remembered that he only had a short while. The bridge groaned as he walked over, the planks were dry and thin. He began to walk faster. </p>
<p>Walking in a zigzag pattern, he kept looking over his back.  After he followed a deer trail beside the river for 100 paces he found the crescent shaped rock that he was looking for.  Squinting his eyes to look into the woods he unbuttoned his shirt and saw the small patch of dirt. A thin patch of baby grass and the myriad of fallen limbs he placed across it made the area appear undisturbed.</p>
<p>His fingers pulsed with a new rush of blood when he saw a stranger walking with a limp down the path. To protect himself, he glared at the stranger. He knew he looked foreign. As the man walked by he said &quot;not a bad day for a little hike, but a little humid though&quot;.</p>
<p>Danh did not answer. He did not understand what the man said. He only understood the word &quot;hello.&quot; </p>
<p>He nodded his head. Once the man had disappeared behind the corner, he knew it was okay to proceed back.  As he tiptoed back towards his truck, the shade of the pine trees cooled his body, but his mind began to heat up. What had he done?  He thought about Daisy, he thought about his hound, and he wondered if this year&#39;s crop would be worth all of his anxiety and effort. </p>
