<h3 id="the-night-uprising">The Night Uprising</h3>
<p>1000° whistled on the floor-</p>
<p>Was it I who healed the frowning sage doll
         &amp; comforted the pale open road,
while you dropped the flashing guard rail 
         &amp; decapitated the smiling gingerbread man?</p>
<p>Did you taste the acrid powder
         &amp; watch the children follow a military beat?</p>
<p>Did you hear my father play a peaceful flute
        &amp; reject the icy darkness?</p>
<p>Did you stand on top of the oily earth
                 &amp; savor the cockroaches grin like wine,
while I sat beneath the chessboard tile sky
                    &amp; heard the firefly squeal?</p>
<p>I knew when I smelt the blue plastic
that it was you who melted
the empty saxophone with rainwater!</p>
<p>You who chose the path of the day &amp; 
                                    it was-</p>
<p>The rabid chainsaw devouring the redwoods’ sinuous trunks
             as the butterflies’ nectar slid on his golden watch.</p>
<p>The plutonium power planted on a fault line
             as the craven raven looked at an electric wire.</p>
<p>The mindful television channel streaming sterility
              into the toddlers embryonic imagination.</p>
<p>The turtle painted red on the pavement 
              by the petroleum horse.</p>
<p>The caterpillars crap pasted to your seat
              littered from the green breathing skeletons. </p>
<p>But when you honored “With Satan I Deceive&quot;
                             &amp; smiled to Benedict Arnold
                             under the guise of ”In God We Trust”
                             I bowed to Benjamin Franklin.</p>
<p>No longer could I ignore the raptured eyes
                              of the fragile saplings.</p>
