<h3 id="the-lady-in-the-attic">The Lady in the Attic</h3>
<p>At dawn, my eyes spasm in the empty room. The hallway splinters with a humid silence as the scent of dew seeps through the window.</p>
<p>I hear some ancient voice sing to me
in the attic&#39;s pine rafters, rhythmically,
as if a rocking chair has gone mad.
Even the bats and dead spiders shiver!
But the stairway,
the stairway just yawns &amp; coughs weakly.</p>
<p>Was it that my pupils dilated to see
the universe of scarlet floating before me
incarcerated in a picture?
There I am framed
in a colonial mirror rising &amp; and baking
like bread inside a brick oven.</p>
<p>Rippling in solid chrome the spectral lady
appears through the attic&#39;s cracked stained-glass.
Her tetrahedral dimensions
reflect flames on a Christian door.</p>
<p>I see her body of beveled liquid &amp; fractal sheets
leaking through the chandelier&#39;s leaded rainbows. The windows paint prison bars across my face. I am closed in by her black-shutter eyebrows &amp; encased in desire.</p>
