<h3 id="mother-earth-s-big-hurt">Mother Earth’s Big Hurt</h3>
<p>How long till quivering wind in Lily padded frog Pond becomes
sharp lightning strike in Lava rocked Methane lake</p>
<p>Pumping gas pedal revs and exhales noxious vapors
Burning money in front of the public transportation dependent transient Burning Mother Earth with dinosaur age petroleum rainbows Burning America with solipsism,</p>
<p>Large “W” Bumper Sticker on an Escalade</p>
