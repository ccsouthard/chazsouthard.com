title: The Bubblegum Sea
---

The party was slightly disrupted when the bubblegum cloud drifted into the top floor of my loft on 16th and Mission.  It did not faze the stoned crowd laid back in the U-shaped couch. They did not move. They just blew smoke triangles and stared at the parabolic circles stitched into the fabric that their bodies were resting on.

Half bottles of booze, abandoned beer cans, dead cigarettes, and shattered tortilla chips were spread about the kitchen countertop. Twenty or so guests moved about the kitchen until the bubble gum cloud quickly evaporated and morphed into hundreds of twisted chrome metal insects the same size as wasps.

The thin Latin girl with sensuous lips by my side was the first to notice.  She grabbed my arm and pointed at the insectile army whose thousand heads were upon her. "Check that shit out!"

A longhaired, bearded man with a corduroy top hat yelled in delight from his slouched position on the floor and pointed a finger. He removed his chopsticks from the eye socket of the antelope's skull before biting into it like a plump grape.  Grabbing the other eyeball, he turned it to face the swarm of insects and said, "I see, but he doesn't".

The Latin girl screamed. No one else noticed, but the bearded man and I. "Leave her alone" I shouted at them as they began to enter the Latin girl's flesh like cactus needles. Instinctually, I went to the refrigerator, latched onto a bowl of rainbow Jell-O and threw it at her.

The metal insects struggled with the Jell-O, succumbing to its gelatinous power. My reaction was promptly repaid with a slap from her thin hand, which bolted down my right cheek and entered the floor splintering the entire loft in two.  A crack began to spew a bubblegum liquid as the building melted into a sea of pink substance that couldn't be categorized as liquid gas or solid.

I'm out of here, the bearded man said, as he pranced through the bay window with the grace of the circus tiger into the cosmic blue night.  Soon the night was dotted with the metal insects and everyone was now awake or semiconscious and leaving in haste. They somersaulted off the balcony, tripped down the spiral staircase, and others dropped into the crack like brass pens.

Following the bearded man's lead I traveled through the bay window, choking on the mist and struggling with the substance as I landed with a rubber thud on a floating wedge of cheese the size of a sedan. The Latin girl and the bearded man were already present, each sitting in the lotus position, and appearing to be meditating deeply.  I touched the Latin girl's shoulder softly, it had turned to stone.  Frantically, I shook the bearded man. No response. The water from the bubblegum sea clashed with the cheese wedge and sprayed a glop of steaming heap of tapioca on my face.

The alarm clock seared the numbers 12:00 upon my tender retina. What is this moisture? Out of one eye the misty image of my boxer appeared above as a large planet discharging lagoons of saliva onto my face.
