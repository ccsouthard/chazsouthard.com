How long till quivering wind in Lily padded frog Pond becomes
sharp lightning strike in Lava rocked Methane lake

Pumping gas pedal revs and exhales noxious vapors
Burning money in front of the public transportation dependent transient Burning Mother Earth with dinosaur age petroleum rainbows Burning America with solipsism,

Large “W” Bumper Sticker on an Escalade
