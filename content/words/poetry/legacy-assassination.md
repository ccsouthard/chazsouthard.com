### Legacy Assassination

Newsflash! Superman Reeve dies A Washington bureaucrat shoots his legislation with silencer.   
Just days later No one hears
Upcoming 2004 election â€” bureaucratic mafia succeeds
Superman disciples carry their suffering
with chairs plastic braces, pharmaceuticals, and catheters
Others disciples have speedball overdoses, suicides, or nursing home fates Vanish and become lost numbers
But with every smart bomb, every M-16 round, or Mid- East roadside surprise
a new cartridge of Disciples are unwillingly born

an antelope herd leaves the crippled behind   
So too does the Mafia boss and his God
