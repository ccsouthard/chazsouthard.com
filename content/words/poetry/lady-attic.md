At dawn, my eyes spasm in the empty room. The hallway splinters with a humid silence as the scent of dew seeps through the window.

I hear some ancient voice sing to me
in the attic's pine rafters, rhythmically,
as if a rocking chair has gone mad.
Even the bats and dead spiders shiver!
But the stairway,
the stairway just yawns & coughs weakly.

Was it that my pupils dilated to see
the universe of scarlet floating before me
incarcerated in a picture?
There I am framed
in a colonial mirror rising & and baking
like bread inside a brick oven.

Rippling in solid chrome the spectral lady
appears through the attic's cracked stained-glass.
Her tetrahedral dimensions
reflect flames on a Christian door.

I see her body of beveled liquid & fractal sheets
leaking through the chandelier's leaded rainbows. The windows paint prison bars across my face. I am closed in by her black-shutter eyebrows & encased in desire.
